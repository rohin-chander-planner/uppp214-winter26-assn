## run notebooks on your computer

you must have a version of anaconda installed, as described on the [resources page](https://knaaptime.com/uppp214-winter25/resources)

1. clone or download these materials 
2. in a terminal, run
    - `cd path/to/uppp214-winter26-assn`
    - `conda env create`
    - `conda activate uppp214-winter26`
    - `jupyter lab`

after you have done this *once*, you no longer need to recreate the environment with `conda env create`, you can skip that step
